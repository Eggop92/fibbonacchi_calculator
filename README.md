5. Click "Next"

6. Click "Attach Policies Directly"

7. Search for "beanstalk"

8. Tick the box next to "AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk"

9. Click "Next"

AWS Keys in Travis

Go to your Travis Dashboard and find the project repository for the application we are working on.

On the repository page, click "More Options" and then "Settings"

Create an AWS_ACCESS_KEY variable and paste your IAM access key

Create an AWS_SECRET_KEY variable and paste your IAM secret key

Deploying App

Make a small change to your src/App.js file in the greeting text.

In the project root, in your terminal run:

git add.
git commit -m “testing deployment"
git push origin main
Go to your Travis Dashboard and check the status of your build.

The status should eventually return with a green checkmark and show "build passing"

Go to your AWS Elastic Beanstalk application

It should say "Elastic Beanstalk is updating your environment"

It should eventually show a green checkmark under "Health". You will now be able to access your application at the external URL provided under the environment name.
